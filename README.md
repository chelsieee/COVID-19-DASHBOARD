## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Using 2 API (recommended by Postman) to fetch COVID-19 historical data:
-1 API for all continent
-1 API for all countries
* Dynamically Utilize CSS/Bootstrap/chart.js to polish the applicate and realise mobile compatibility
* Provide 2 ways of display of Covid data: bar chart and table

To-do list:
* source API is outdated and this application only represent historical data will need to change the API source to be updated to date
* construct basic element with class and use a constructor function to create a basic class and inherit class in order to avoid duplication of codes

## Status
Project is: _in progress_

## Inspiration
Project inspired by the fact that many people have to search and went on different government pages to have access to COVID-19 data and in this project, I try to combine all continent/city data into a simple website with the search function to visualise the key data in a more user-friendly way
